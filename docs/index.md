MAPIT has worked well in internal testing with the included example dataset and with several example `.csv` and `.mat` datasets. However, there may be some unusual edge cases which will cause the tool to fail.

 Further, V&V for MAPIT is ongoing! Users are responsible for performing their own due diligence to ensure results make sense.
